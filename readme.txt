All-in-One WP Migration is the only tool that you will ever need to migrate a WordPress site.

== Description ==

The plugin allows you to export your database, media files, plugins, and themes.
You can apply unlimited find and replace operations on your database and the plugin will also fix any serialization problems that occur during find/replace operations.

All in One WP Plugin is the first plugin to offer true mobile experience on WordPress versions 3.3 and up.

= Not yet Multisite compatible =
* Support for multisites is comming soon

= Works on Windows OS and IIS =
* Tested the plugin on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2012 with the default available IIS
* You will need to make sure that Windows\TEMP folder has write permissions for the IIS user

= memory_limit requirement of only 32MB =
* The plugin handles archiving of files by using 2048 bytes of chunks
* The plugin processes database find/replacement in chunks of 1MB

= Bypass all upload size restriction =
* We use chunks to import your data and that way we bypass any webserver upload size restrictions up to **512MB** - commercial version supports up to **5GB**

= Works with PHP v5.2.17 and above =
* We tested the plugin on a php compiled with the following modules:
`./configure --with-zlib --with-mysql`

= Support for MySQL, PDO, MySQLi =
* No matter what php mysql driver your webserver ships with, we support it

= Support for ZipArchive and PclZIP =
* Your export files are archived using the fast ZipArchive pecl extension. If your server doesn't have it, we fall back to PclZIP which is included in WordPress

= WordPress v3.3 Support =
* We tested every WordPress version from `3.3` up to `3.9.2`
