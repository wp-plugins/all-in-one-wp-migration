All-in-One WP Migration is the only tool that you will ever need to migrate a WordPress site.

== Description ==
The plugin allows you to export your database, media files, plugins, and themes.
You can apply unlimited find/replace operations on your database and the plugin will also fix any serialization problems that occur during find/replace operations.

All in One WP Plugin is the first plugin to offer true mobile experience on WordPress versions 3.3 and up.

= Works on all hosting providers =
* The plugin does not depend on any extensions, making it compatible with all PHP hosting providers.
* The plugin exports and imports data in time chunks of 3 seconds each, which keeps the plugin below the max execution time that most providers set to 30 seconds.
* We have tested the plugin on the major Linux distributions, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows.

= Bypass all upload size restriction =
* We use chunks to import your data and that way we bypass any webserver upload size restrictions up to **512MB** - commercial version supports up to **5GB**.

= 0 Dependencies =
* The plugin does not require any php extensions and can work with PHP v5.2.

= Support for MySQL, PDO, MySQLi =
* No matter what php mysql driver your webserver ships with, we support it.

= Support WordPress v3.3 up to v4.2 =
* We tested every WordPress version from `3.3` up to `4.2`.
